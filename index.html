			<h2>My Interests in IT</h2>
			<p>
				I have had an interest in IT since my years in high school.  I was looking into possible careers that I could move into and found a
				description on the Mechatronics Engineering field.  I found it interesting that it focused on combining different areas of electrical, mechanical and software
				to develop automated systems.  When I graduated from high school, I began study Mechatronics Engineering for 3 years, before I decided to move to Software Engineering.  
				During that time, I worked for an IT support company for a year to complete my work experience qualification for my degree and graduate.
			</p>
			<p>
				I have chosen to come to RMIT to help sharpen my skills in the IT industry.  I am currently looking for work, after having completed my Bachelor of Engineering degree.  
				During this time, I wanted to try and maintain my current skill set, as well as add new ones.  I felt that RMIT would provide me with the flexibility to study while looking 
				and eventually working in the IT industry.
			</p>
			<p>
				Throughout the course of my studies, I expect to gain more experience in the skills that I have developed in my previous studies.  However, I am also looking to learn new 
				skills such as web development, which I have not had much exposure to.  I am also looking to learn more about networks, their security, and how to develop software for them.  
			</p>
		</div>
		
		<div>
			<h2>Ideal Job</h2>
			<p>
				This position is focused on the development and integration of software to support robotic platforms and automated systems.  The role will involve working within a team to 
				develop software that help researchers to perform their tasks.  The role will also include being involved in project planning that is based on a client’s needs, as well as performing 
				and maintaining processes that have been set in place to support the client.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				The skills that are required for this position require experience working with several different software packages and applications, as well as a relevant degree in software engineering.  
				The software packages that the role requires includes the Robotic Operating System, DevOps, and Docker.  The position also requires experience in working with Linux-based operating systems.  
				This role also requires experience in developing image processing and robotic vision systems, and knowledge in the communication protocols.  The role also requires oral and communication skills, 
				as well as the ability to work independently.
			</p>
			<p>
				I have a Bachelor of Engineering, majoring in Computer and Software Systems, which should meet the qualification requirement.  As part of my role in an IT support company, I have had to communicate 
				with clients and other technicians on a regular basis, so I believe that I have the communication skills for this role.  Of the skills they require or find desirable, I have experience with machine 
				vision and image processing, as well as some understanding of the ROS package and real-time software development.  Throughout my studies, I have also gained a working understanding of Linux operating 
				systems.  
			</p>
			<p>
				Currently I am lacking experience in DevOps and Docker deployments.  I also feel that my experience with ROS and real-time software development is lacking, along with my knowledge of communication 
				protocols.  In order to gain knowledge in these skills, I will take online course in ROS, Docker, and DevOps.  I will then try to incorporate these skills with D.I.Y projects to develop a working 
				understanding of the packages.  I would also take some courses in image processing to improve my skills in this area.  I will also move to use the Linux operating systems as my main OS, so to have 
				more experience in this area.  I will also be looking to do research on communication protocols by taking courses and using different network packages and network analysis software such as WireShark 
				to increase my knowledge in this area.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h2>Personal Profile</h2>
			<p>
				The big five personality test and the Myers-Briggs test indicate that I am introverted and struggle with social interactions.  They also indicate that I prefer hard facts over guesses
				and assumption.  They also indicate that I am responsible, and dependable when others need my help, but am less likely to get involved with others on a personal level.  The two tests 
				indicate that I like to plan and make early decisions and preparations, however my personality test indicates that I am somewhat able to try new things and focus on new problems.  
				My learning style indicates that I predominantly learn through visual stimulus with help from practical exercises.  I struggle to learn from auditory input.
			</p>
			<p>
				I believe that these results will influence my behaviour within the team right from the outset.  I believe and have noticed in projects that I have been a part of, that I will take
				some time to warm up to the team before I begin to openly work with others and offer my ideas.  However, I would also not support or discuss any decisions or statements that were not
				made with clear facts that my team would make.  I also believe that as I become more comfortable with my team, I will be more involved in helping them when they have issues with 
				something they are working on.  However, I will try to keep them at distance, and maintain only a working relationship with them.  With regards to my learning style, I think that I 
				would struggle to understand when a team member would try to explain something to me vocally, it would take me less time to understand if they showed me or I performed the task that 
				they were explaining.
			</p>
			<p>
				With regards to forming a team, I believe I should choose a team of individuals that are similar in nature.  I believe I would work better with individuals that had a desire to make 
				decisions based on facts and not feelings.  I believe it would necessary to have an extroverted member within the team to help support the team in the initial stages, as it would take 
				some time for introverts to become comfortable with each other.   When forming the team, it would also be better to choose individuals that are work-oriented and dependable.

			<h2>Project Idea: Alexa-Pi Robot</h2>
				<h3>Overview</h3>
				<p>
					The project is focused on the development of a robot that is controlled via Amazon’s voice-assistant, Alexa.  The aim of this project is to use the Amazon Alexa services to send 
					voice commands to a robot to make it move around a room.  This robot will consist of a Raspberry Pi to act as the communication relay and controller for the robot, and an Arduino 
					Uno to control the motors of the robot.  The user will then provide a voice command to the voice-assistant, which will be transmitted to and translated by the Raspberry Pi, before 
					the command is sent to the Arduino Uno to perform the specific command.  A Raspberry Pi camera is also attached that will be used to forward a camera feed or take pictures and 
					display them on an Amazon Echo device.
				</p>
				
				<h3>Motivation</h3>
				<p>
					The development of this project will be interesting as it will provide a robot that can be driven using specific voice commands.  There are also additional levels of complexity, 
					as this project involves network configuration, as well as configuring serial communication between the Raspberry Pi and Arduino.  There have been projects that have focused on 
					developing robots that are controlled with Amazon’s Alexa services, and projects to use the Raspberry Pi camera as a security camera that can be displayed on Amazon’s Echo devices.  
					As such, combining these two concepts together would result in a smart mobile security camera that could move around a specific area. 
				</p>
				<h3>Description</h3>
				<p>
					The robot that is to be designed will have several different features incorporated into its design.  This robot will be interfaced with Amazon Alexa, to allow the user to command 
					the robot with their voice.  Using Amazon Alexa, the user will be able to provide simple commands such as to move or rotate a certain distance.  The user will also be able to 
					request Alexa to display a live video or still image from the camera that is built into the robot.  For example, the user might use the following phrase:
				</p>
				<p>
						<i>Alexa, turn the robot 30° clockwise.</i>
				</p>
				<p>
						<i>Alexa, show me the view from the robot.</i>
				</p>
					The above commands would cause the robot to rotate 30° clockwise from its current position.  The next command would access the onboard camera and transmit the live feed to the 
					screen of the Echo device through a secure TLS connection.  To be able to view the video stream from the robot, an Amazon Echo Show or Amazon Echo Spot is required.  Other 
					commands that can be given will include requesting the robot to move in a certain direction or taking an image.
				</p>
				<p>	
					The robot will be constructed with a light-weight chassis made of MDF board.  The chassis will have two stories, to increase the compactness of the robot.  The Arduino and 
					the motorised wheels will be placed on the bottom layer, while the Raspberry Pi and camera are placed on the top layer.  The motors will be placed on either side of the 
					chassis, with a caster while placed facing forward to support and balance the robot.  Raspberry Pi camera will be placed facing forward to capture everything in the direction 
					that is in the robot’s field of view.
				</p>
				<p>	
					The robot will make use of a Raspberry Pi to act as the main processor.  All commands from Alexa will be given and processed through the Raspberry Pi.  The in-built Raspberry Pi 
					WiFi module will provide the robot with the ability to receive commands from the Alexa voice-assistant.  The Raspberry Pi will also be connected to a camera which will be used 
					to take photos or display a live feed that can be requested by Alexa to display to the user.  To control the movement and direction of the robot, an Arduino Uno will be used for 
					its ability to read and write analogue signals.  This will increase the precision of the movements of the robot.
				</p>
				<p>
					A portable battery will be attached to the robot, which will be connected to the power connection on the Raspberry Pi.  This ensures that the robot will not be tethered to an 
					electrical socket as it roams throughout the environment.  The Raspberry Pi will be attached to an Arduino Uno via a USB-B cable which will supply power and a data connection 
					to the Arduino Uno, which will provide a two-way line of communication between the devices.  Four AA batteries will also be attached to the robot to provide power to the two 
					motors that will drive the robot.  
				</p>

					The development will be done using the Python SDK to develop the Alexa interface and the serial communication between the Raspberry Pi and the Arduino Uno.  The Arduino IDE 
					will be used to develop the software that will be used to control the motors of the robot.
				</p>
				<h3>Skills Required</h3>
				<p>
					The skills that are required for this project involve some amount of software expertise, as well as some electrical and mechanical expertise to connect the motors to Arduino Uno a
					nd solder the connections into place and construct the chassis of the robot.  The software skills that are required include expertise in the Python programming language, as well as 
					some expertise in the C programming language to develop software on the Raspberry Pi and the Arduino Uno respectively.  Experience using Amazon’s Developer console is also required 
					to develop the voice user interface that will be used to invoke movement for the robot.   Tutorials for the development of this software is readily available, however the electrical 
					and mechanical work will require special tools, such as a soldering iron, and wood working to create the chassis.
				</p>
				<h3>Outcome</h3>
				<p>
					The outcome of this project will result in a robot that is capable of moving based on commands given to Amazon’s Alexa voice-assistant.  Additionally, with the attached camera, it 
					will also allow users to view what the robot is seeing from an Amazon Echo device.  As such it will provide a cheaper option than some other options such as the Lynx robot, or the 
					Anki Cozmo Robot.  If this project is successful, it will also provide the opportunity to expand further by adding additional features, such as object recognition and waypoint movement, 
					which could be used to tell the robot to move to specific objects within its field of view.
